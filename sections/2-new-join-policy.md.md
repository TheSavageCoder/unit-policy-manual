# Section 2 - New Join Policy 

## 2-1. Overview

New joins follow a structured training program to become members of our unit. New joins will enter our Recruit Pipeline; a series of training events to gain the basic knowledge and skills necessary to fill an entry level billet. This training program provides team leaders with capable team members and affords the new join an opportunity to decide if they are a good fit for our unit before progressing further.

## 2-2. Qualification

The following denotes the minimum requirements to gain access to the unit as a member. Applicants must be at least 16 years of age. All applicants must have a valid legal working copy of Armed Assault III and the APEX DLC. All applicants must have a working microphone/ speakers/ headset with a working Teamspeak 3 VoIP Client. Finally, all applicants must successfully complete the standardized application process.

## 2-3. Standardized Application Process

All new joins will follow a standardized application process which consists of filling out the appropriate unit application. All 16+ applicants must seek entry into the 15th MEU as a Basic Unit Member and fill out the approved Basic Unit Member Application. All applications must be properly filled out and checked over by a member of the Recruiting Detachment. Any discrepancies or omissions in this application will delay the potential new member from entering the Recruit Pipeline. All Recruiting Detachment personnel will respond to the application once processed in one the following ways:

 1. ACCEPTED: The application topic name will be denoted with “ACCEPTED” and a reply to the application will be posted with the approved automated acceptance response. Accepted applicants will receive a welcome message via private message on the forum. This message will include reporting and training instructions.

 2. DENIED: The application topic name will be denoted with “DENIED” and a reply to the application will be posted with the approved automated denial response. The applicant will be notified via PM as to the reason for the denial along with contact information should the applicant wish to discuss the matter further

 3. RECYCLED: The application topic name will be denoted with “RECYCLED” and a reply to the application will be posted with the appropriate response. This type of denial is only used when the applicant is timed out, or otherwise withdraws their application.

 4. NEEDS APPLICANTS ATTENTION: The application topic name will be denoted with “NEEDS APPLICANTS ATTENTION” and a reply to the application will be posted with the information needed for the applicant to correct the discrepancy identified in the application.

 5. ON HOLD: The application is awaiting a response from another S-section or other personnel outside of recruiting in order to process the application. Needed parties have been informed and a response will be sent as soon as possible.

### 2-3.A. Multi-Membership

No member in the unit may have more than one membership to the unit. Members are free to request a name change for privacy purposes, but new membership profiles are not authorized. Should a member be found to be in violation of this policy, their most recently created membership account will be removed from the unit and all information maintained on the individual's personnel file will be transferred to their remaining active membership account. 

### 2-3.B. Returning Members

All past unit members that are seeking to regain entry into the unit, and are no longer affiliated with the 15th MEU at their current state, must re-complete the standardized application process. All applications must be properly filled out and checked over by a member of the Recruiting Detachment. Once processed, all returning member applications will be flagged for review by one of the designated S-1 Personnel Clerks who will review the application and all pertinent information regarding the member's previous membership for reasons the member should not regain access to the unit, should any exist. The application topic name will be denoted with “S-1 Flag” and the appropriate automated message will be posted in reply to the application. In the event a reason is identified why the returning member should be denied entry, The S-1 Personnel Clerk will forward this information to the S-1 Personnel Officer for review. The S-1 Personnel Officer will then determine how to proceed with the applicant and react accordingly. Additionally, all returning Aviation Combat Element (ACE) Personnel will require review and approval from the ACE Commanding Officer before being approved for return to Aviation Combat Element.

## 2-4. Basic Training

Basic Training consists of two separate phases: Recruit Training and the School of Infantry (ITB/FMTB). 

### 2-4.A. Recruit Training

Recruit Training is the first phase of Basic Training. It is a series of three (3) training sessions that are required for every new applicant to complete before becoming a new member of the Unit. At the end of Recruit Training Day 3, graduates are asked to choose an entry-level billet from the Currently Open Billets. The Recruit Training Instructors will process the graduates’ forum profiles and provide them access to the appropriate forum to report in. If the graduate has a desired Platoon/Detachment and Squad/Section, they may request it while reporting in. Most requests are granted, however staffing changes occur often and graduates are asked to provide a backup billet choice in case the billet they requested is closed. Graduates who request 0311 Rifleman do not have to choose a backup billet.

### 2-4.B School of Infantry

The School of Infantry (SOI) is the second phase of Basic Training, and is required for all Ground Combat Element (GCE) members. At SOI, new unit members are separated into two different training schools depending on their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS): Infantry Training Battalion (ITB) and Fleet Medical Training Battalion (FMTB).

#### 2-4.B.1 Infantry Training Battalion

All members entering any 03 Occupational Field (0311 Rifleman, 0331 Machine Gunner, and 1800 Armor crewman) will enter the Infantry Training Battalion (ITB) at SOI. Here, they will take three courses (Heliborne Infantry School, Motorized Infantry School, and Mechanized/Amphibious Infantry School) learning the infantry skills required in the 15th MEU (SOC) Realism Unit. Once completing this course, all members meeting appropriate time in grade and combined score will be eligible for promotion to Private First Class. Members not taking a 0311 MOS will receive further specialized training within their MOS from their assigned unit.

#### 2-4.B.2 Fleet Medical Training Battalion

All members entering the HM-8404 Occupational Field will enter the Fleet Medical Training Battalion (FMTB) at SOI. Here, they will take part in a two day course over the span of one week designed to teach new corpsman the basics of both combat tactics and casualty care. While the real life FMTB has nothing to do with SOI, our unit has grouped it with ITB for convenience. 

## 2-5. Personnel Assignment Policy

Personnel are free to request a specific assignment that they would like to fill, but there is no guarantee that this request will be honored. After completing Recruit Training, personnel that do not request a specific assignment will be assigned to billets based on an as needed basis. This means that personnel will fill vacancies which exist in the order of most under strengthened section first. Once a section is brought to the same number of active members as its counterpart, personnel will be assigned equally across the entirety of the MOS Field. With all this in mind, all attempts to keep individual groups of friends together will be made, but will not directly conflict with this policy.

## 2-6. Military Occupational Specialty Training

Every new join to the unit is destined for a particular billet that he will fill. This training is considered MOS Training. All other non 0311 Rifleman and HM-8404 Hospital Corpsman go through a one to two hour course on the specifics of their job with the unit. New joins wanting to become pilots must have 90 days time in service before they are eligible to apply for the Student Pilot Program within ACE (A 45 day TIS waiver may be applied to any ACE application opening that remains unfilled for 3 weeks). 

## 2-7. Points and Rifle Range Qualifications

New recruits entering the Recruit Pipeline may attend training outside of the School of Infantry trainings, but may not earn CSE points until the completion of Recruit Training. New joins also may not attend unit wide operations or ITX’s until its completion. New joins will have their first opportunity to fire a rifle range after Recruit Training by utilizing the rifle range schedule and attending a time and date specified there. A qualifying rifle range score is required for promotion to E-3. Standard Rifle Range Policy is in effect; they may only shoot for score three times in between the qualification period. 

## 2-8. 30 Day Billet Lock Policy

Upon completion of recruit training, you will select an MOS. After that selection you will be locked into that MOS for 30 days. 

## 2-9. Special Recruiting Policies

Should any new members join the unit and bring with them two or more friends that complete SOI, we will allow one of the group members to be authorized a meritorious promotion to the rank of Private First Class. The group members must decide who among them shall receive this meritorious promotion. Should the members not agree then no meritorious promotion shall be authorized. This promotion does not come with a guarantee of a leadership billet. Additionally, if six or more members of a group complete SOI, one of the members is authorized meritorious Lance Corporal and one member meritorious Private First Class with the same guidelines of selection as above. No other meritorious promotions are authorized.

## 2-10. Restrictions

In the interest of fairness the 15th MEU (SOC) does not recognize other unit’s ranks or real military ranks for transfer into the unit. There is no real way to confirm a person’s status in the real world without a meet and greet and that is not going to be conducted or authorized by the Command Staff. Other unit ranks are not recognized because we do not know what their promotion guidelines are like and how a member became a certain rank within that organization. In short, everyone earns their rank in the 15th MEU (SOC) from the ground up.
