# Preface

The purpose of this manual is to aid members of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (15th MEU) Realism Unit in understanding the rules and regulations that define and guide this unit. These rules and regulations are commonly referred to in Marine terminology as Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The SOP’s are the rules that govern specific actions within this unit and are followed with few exceptions. Temporary waivers to SOP are only authorized by the Command Staff.

The SOP’s were created by the Command Staff to guide daily operations and implement a plan for the future of this unit. The SOP’s were carefully tailored to fit the needs of the unit and have been revised over the years to adapt to new challenges and situations. These revisions have come from Command Staff review and member suggestions upon identifying a problem or better way of doing things. All changes to unit SOPs must be approved by the Command Staff.

Please contact the MEU HQ with questions, corrections or errors regarding this manual.

# Unit History

In June 2007, two gamers from the 22nd MEU, and Battlefield 2 Project Reality Unit, got together to test a new game on the market. These two gamers instantly fell in love with the variety and realism the game offered, despite its many bugs at the time. Mere days after downloading the demo, both gamers picked up the retail version and called aboard another two players from the 22nd MEU. That game was Armed Assault, or as it’s now known, ArmA 1. After a series of lengthy conversations between the four gamers, one of them an ex-marine, they parted ways with the 22nd MEU to stand up their own unit. Three of the four gamers would take leadership roles, as the ex-marine would strictly consult.

On 21 June 2007, these four gamers stood up the 15th MEU Realism Unit: 1stLt J. Schultz, 1stLt J. Savage, GySgt Phillips, and soon-to-be Sgt Tigernan. The founding composition of the 15th MEU comprised two fireteams from 1st Platoon Echo Company 2/4, supported by two AH-1s and two MH-6s (due to the lack of UH-1s in ArmA 1) from HMLA-369, the “Gunfighters” and “Gunrunners”.

Faced with increasing membership and increasing real-world obligations, GySgt Phillips resigned from his role as the platoon sergeant. Sgt Tigernan stood up to the task and would eventually take on the role of MEU 1stSgt. The rest is written in stone.

As the 15th MEU steadily grew, it added new billets and new supporting elements to complement the ever-expanding infantry section. Over the last decade of unit history, a large number of sections have been added, removed, returned, consolidated, replaced, and held dear by our members.

The sections that have at one point or another been added to the 15th MEU are:

† - sections that have since closed

** - sections that have since closed and reopened

On top of these additions, the inner workings of the unit have grown to accommodate the manpower required to run a behemoth like the 15th. Each S-denoted section serves as a specific vertebrae on a delicate spine that carries the weight of the MEU.

These sections are:
 * S-1 Personnel
 * S-2 Intelligence
 * S-3 Training and Operations
 * S-4 Logistics
 * S-9 Civil Affairs

To also cope with the growing numbers and possible tensions that may rise when hundreds of unknowns get together, the MEU currently has several Unit Counselors in service who welcome all members with open doors in the occasion of a unit related dispute.

Along with new elements, the MEU has also seen a wide range of schools and courses
put into use during its lifespan. These include the Flight School, ITB, MCT, FMSS, Leadership courses, specific MOS training, and different Range Courses to name a few.

Back when the unit was taking its first steps, the only actual course you had to take was Recruit Training. The Recruit Training document currently in use has an edit history all the way back to 2007, when the unit was first founded, making it the oldest training document in use.

In its current state, the 15th MEU stands as one of the largest and most popular realism units out on the market, satisfying online gamers with "as-close-as-you-want-to-get" Marine action.

On January 28, 2013. The 15th MEU surpassed 1000 trained recruits. On May 16, 2014 the 2000th recruit joined the unit, with the 3000th member joining August 27, 2016.
